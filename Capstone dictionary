The Forest Condition Survey is based upon the assessment of five tree species: 

Norway spruce NS 
Sitka spruce SS
Scots pine SP
oak OK
beech BE 

Each year, between late June and September, the condition of approximately 8400 trees distributed across a network of 350 permanent monitoring plots was determined. Plots consist of 24 trees located in four sub-plots of six trees and, depending upon the species assessed, between 29 and 33 features indicative of condition are scored for each tree. The feature of greatest interest is an assessment of crown density: an estimate of the degree of transparency of the crown which is used as an index of tree condition.
